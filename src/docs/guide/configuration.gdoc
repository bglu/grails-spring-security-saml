h1. Configuration options for the plugin

{note}
Any property overrides must be specified in @grails-app/conf/Config.groovy@ using the @grails.plugin.springsecurity@ suffix, for example
{code}
grails.plugin.springsecurity.saml.active = true
{code}
{note}

There are several configuration options for the Shibbolet Natibe SP plugin. In practice the defaults are fine for most deployments and only a few will need to be overridden.
